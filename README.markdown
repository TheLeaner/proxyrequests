## Description
Proxyrequests is (will be) a proxy grabber, checker and request handler (single and paralell). Class proxylist scrapes proxies from daily updated online lists and saves them to a file. It can also check existing proxy lists. Class requests can easily initiate paralell or single http GET | POST connections tunneled through proxies from our proxy file.


## System requirements
* PHP curl extension

## Instructions
1. Include the requests class in your project and initiate it

## Changelog

#### Nov 20 2011
* 
### Jan 30 2012
* Proxylist handler is now a class
* Added a proxy checker

## Known issues
* curl_multi requests only work stable on 1020- instances at a time, so that should be the maximum limit of your paralell connections, but if you have more than 1020 proxies, the program will wait for the requests to complete and then execute the rest in a loop
